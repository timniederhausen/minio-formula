# Setup variables using grains['osarch'] based logic.
# You just need to add the key:values for an `osarch` that differ
# from `defaults.yaml`.
# Only add an `osarch` which is/will be supported by the formula.
#
# If you do not need to provide defaults via the `osarch` grain,
# you will need to provide at least an empty dict in this file, e.g.
# osarch: {}
